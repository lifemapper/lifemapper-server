# Note: This install is a hack.  Built python egg on roll-building server 
#       and added it to source directory.  The mapscript*egg.tar.gz file
#       must be uncompressed into /opt/python/lib/python3.6/site-packages.
#
#       Error was during rpm build - byte-compile for rpm always used python2.7 
#       and mapscript.py failed to compile.
